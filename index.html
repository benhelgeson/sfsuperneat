The Rewindable Entity Iterator<br />
==============================<br /><br />

Our EntityIterators are composed of a standard PDO PreparedStatement and a <br />
DataMapper.  The DataMapper maps rows into objects in real time as we iterate <br />
over the the Statement.  There is a limitation with PDO Statements in that you<br />
can only iterate over them one time.  <br /><br />

For example:<br /><br />

    // first loop works fine<br />
    foreach($statement as $result) {<br />
        // do something with result<br />
    }<br /><br />
    
    // but subsequent loops don't<br />
    foreach($statement as $result) {<br />
        // never called <br />
    }<br /><br />

Since our EntityIterator operates by iterating over the statement it <br />
can also only be looped over once.  This causes all sorts of problems.<br /><br />

Your Job<br />
--------<br /><br />

Derive a RewindableEntityIterator from the EntityIterator class.  Your new <br />
iterator should be rewindable and thus able to iterate over its elements <br />
repeatedly.  To simplify the task we have used a ResultSet object instead of a <br />
PDO Statement.  The EntityIterator iterates over the ResultSet object <br />
directly.  Like the PDO Statement, the ResultSet does not have the ability to rewind.<br /><br />

A few constraints and notes<br />
---------------------------<br /><br />

* Implement the RewindableEntityIterator class in the src directory<br />
* Do not alter any other files in the src directory<br />
* There are quite a few corner cases to consider<br />
* There is a PHPUnit test file in the tests directory - add additional tests if it's helpful to you.<br />
* Be conscious of time & space complexity<br /><br />

Good luck<br />
